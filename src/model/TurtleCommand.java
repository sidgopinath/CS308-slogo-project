 * This very important class holds information about Turtles
 * The getters and setters in this class are called across the program
 * This class allows the model and the view to communicate
 * The model places information into a TurtleCommand and then sends it to the View
 * The view can read the information in TurtleCommands and move the Turtle accordingly
 * This class is primarily used for commands that physically move the Turtle
